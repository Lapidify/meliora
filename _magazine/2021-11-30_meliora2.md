  note: Swaying to and fro within four walls, switching screens, twiddling thumbs,
    yet crippled by unsettling uncertainties, lockdown has become the new normal
    to most of us! On one such unproductive day, the thought of brushing up the
    idea of an E-newsletter sprang up! All it took was a video call with the
    enthusiastic and dedicated bunch, the crew behind the first edition, the
    students of 2019 Batch who sparked  up and carried the thought forward
    despite the ever changing University schedules. Being the first of its kind,
    it is with immense pride and happiness that I present to you MELIORA, an
    initiative of the Magazine Committee, Navodhan 20-21 as the  voice of fellow
    SGMCians.

  Greetings to all

  After a pause, here’s the second edition of Meliora to mark our statement of solidarity with the authenticity in being oneself fearlessly, standing hand in hand with the oppressed and admiration for the struggles of survival rights.

  With utmost happiness I present before you the Meliora’2 featuring PRIDE! A collection of works of 2020 batch.
