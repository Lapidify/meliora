  Swaying to and fro within four walls, switching screens, twiddling thumbs, yet crippled by unsettling uncertainties, lockdown has  become the new normal to most of us!
  On one  such unproductive day, the thought of brushing up the idea of an E-newsletter sprang up! All it took was a video call with the enthusiastic and dedicated bunch, the crew  behind the first edition, the students of 2019 Batch who sparked  up and carried  the thought forward despite the ever changing university schedules. Being the first of its kind, it is with immense pride and happiness  that I present to you MELIORA,  an initiative of the Magazine Committee, Navodhan 20-21 as the  voice of fellow SGMCians.
